<h3>Cisco Telephone System in Missoula MT 59801</h3>
<p>The internet, which you already use every day, becomes your phone lines. With traditional phone lines, callers would end up in voicemail if they couldn't reach someone. That makes now an ideal time for clients to switch to a cloud-based phone system rather of paying huge charges to update your existing phone system that might last just three or four more years. While these systems still use conventional phone service, they also include other communication tools that professionals now depend on.</p>
<p>Calls from your smart phone will appear as your office phone in Caller ID. Since the voice signal is separated into data packages as an IP call, spread over the internet, and reassembled at its destination (sort of like a Star Trek transporter), rather than tying up a copper peer-to-peer landline circuit, phone calls are less expensive through VoIP-- another savings point. Instead of using telephone lines, VoIP uses SIP trunks (SIP represents session initiation procedure).</p>
