For the most part, voice calls (whether made by routine telephone or another VoIP number) placed to a VoIP number can be gotten on the computer system itself; or routed to a regular telephone, cellular phone, or mobile phone.</p>
<p>Now speaking about VoIP, these phones need to be linked to the AC source or a connector called Power over Ethernet (PoE) injector should be present, as they assist the phones to derive their power and information through comparable network cable television.
